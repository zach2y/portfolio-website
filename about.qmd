I am a PhD graduate from Kanazawa University, Japan with expertise in cell and molecular biology. My research focus was to better understand the cell signaling pathways during inflammatory responses in the intestines. I enjoy finding solutions to research questions or technical problems.

Currently mastering various tools in data science to improve my ability to gain insights into data and solve problems.
